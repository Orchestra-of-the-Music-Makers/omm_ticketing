# OMM Ticketing Frontend

Frontend for OMM Ticketing system

## How to Run

### Locally

```bash
$ mv .env.sample .env # fill in env file with proper values
$ source .env
$ make elm
```

### Netlify

Look at `netlify.toml`

Set your environment variable on Netlify Deploy settings.

## I don't know elm where do I start?

1. Look at `index.html` if you want to add css/js files.
1. Look at `src/Main.elm` if you want to change the markup/add class to an element etc.
